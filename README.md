# cicd-bootc
Demo repo for Github Actions based builds of bootc images

For RHEL, this example uses an activation key to get access to a subscription and a service account to get access to the terms based registry images. These are set up as secrets and variables scoped to the repo.You can easily change the names of these in the repo and the workflow file to suit your own standards.

## Accessing a subscription during build
To use packages from the RHEL repositories, the builder will need to have subscription information available. This workflow will register the container, execute the build, and then unregister as a 
final step. You will only be using the subscription for the duration of the build. To use subscription-manager in a pipieline like this, it's easiest to use an activation key. If you don't have a subscription already, the [No-cost RHEL for developers subscription](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download) is a good option.

If you aren't familiar with actionvation keys, from the docs:
> An activation key is a preshared authentication token that enables authorized users to register and auto-configure systems. Running a registration command with an activation key and organization  ID combination, instead of a username and password combination, increases security and facilitates automation.

[Creating an activation key in the console](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/subscription_central/1-latest/html/getting_started_with_activation_keys_on_the_hybrid_cloud_console/assembly-creating-managing-activation-keys#proc-creating-act-keys-console_)

Create 2 secrets in the repo

Organization ID as *RHT_ORGID*

Activation key as *RHT_ACT_KEY*

## Getting access to the base image
Ublike UBI, the bootc base image does require an account to access since this is a full RHEL host. To log into the registry during a pipeline build or other automation, you can [create a regitry service account}(https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication#registry-service-accounts-for-shared-environments-4) in tne customer portal.

### Token Information
Create 1 var and 1 secret in the repo

Token username as *RHT_REG_SVCUSER* (has a "|" character in the name)

Password as *RHT_REG_SVCPASS*

### Possible runner disk space issue
These build are full operating systems so can be very big builds depending on the amount of software installed.  Valentin rerported this issue with a different bootc based GitHub Action build:

> the infamous "no space left on device" issue building my fedora-bootc-workstation image which brought me to https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/25678. 

Based on that discussion and some back and forth on an issue in this repo, we have a version of the fix that will work with this containerized approach here.  If your build starts failing due to space issues on the runner, you can mount `/opt` from the host read / write in the container and then remove the tool cache.

Change the options in the container specification in the job:
```
      options: --privileged -v /opt:/host/opt:rw
```

Add the following step as the first step in the job (before the checkout):
```
      - name: Free up disk space on runner
        run: |
          rm -rf /host/opt/hostedtoolcache
          df -Th
```
You can remove the `df` if you don't want to log how much free space is available after remove the tool cache. On a test repo, this removed about 8GB of tools on the host that aren't used since this job runs completely containerized.
